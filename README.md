# Cheerio-Scraper

## Project Overview
This project includes a client-side interface, with an express.js server, and server-side routing. The app is designed to scrape news articles from a news webpage and then display this on the front page. The user is then able to save and comment on articles that they so choose to. (Not functioning: saving and commenting).

## Building the App
1. We will first need to initialize our Github Repository and create the following files:
    1. server.js - this file will contain the main server code 
    2. htmlRoutes.js- these will be the route handling files for handling get and post requests from the client.
    3. main.handlebars, index.handlebars- these will be the HTML templates for our home page and Saved Page
    4. home.js - this file runs client-side javascript 
    5. Models- our Index, Article, and Saved Models will be defined in their appropriate .js files as Mongoose Schemas
